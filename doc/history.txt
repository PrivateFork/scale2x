                              History For Scale2x
                              ===================


1 SCALE2X V2.1 2004/08
======================

* Added the `scale2x3' and `scale2x4' effects.
* Fixed the computation of the border pixels for scale3x.
* Fixed the scalebit.c implementation to be C++
  compatible [Max Horn]


2 SCALE2X V2.0 2004/02
======================

* Added a new revision of the `scale3x' effect. It now looks good as
  `scale2x'.
* Added a new optimized C version of the `scale2x' effect.
* Added a detailed algorithm specification in the `algorithm.txt' file.
* Minor fixes at the scalebit.c file.


3 SCALE2X V1.6 2003/07
======================

* Added an example of the fast implementation of the effects
  applied to a generic bitmap. There is also an
  example for the not obvious Scale4x effect.
* Revised the command line tools. Now they support all the
  formats of .PNG images. Also images with 16 bits per
  channel.
* Fixed a linking problem with some libpng installations.


4 SCALE2X V1.5 2003/05
======================

* Added the scale3x and scale4x command line tools.


5 SCALE2X V1.4 2003/01
======================

* Added in the contrib dir a VisualC MMX assembler implementation
  by VisualBoy from the VisualBoyAdvance emulator.


6 SCALE2X V1.3 2002/12
======================

* Added the contrib dir with some example implementations.
  Java by Randy Power and C SDL by Pete Shinners.


7 SCALE2X V1.2 2002/11
======================

* The new Scale2x site is now http://scale2x.sourceforge.net
* The MMX implementation now correctly computes the pixel on the
  left and right border.
* Renamed the -t option in -w.


8 SCALE2X V1.1 2002/11
======================

* Added the -t option at the command line converter.


9 SCALE2X V1.0 2002/11
======================

* First version of the library
